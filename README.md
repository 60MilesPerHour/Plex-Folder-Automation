# Plex-Automation
Automatically create Plex folders and sub folders for Plex media (Music, TV)


So... i hate organizing files in plex... so... i got my computer to do it for me!

still requires input from the user but it takes away all the annoying crap you'd usually have to deal with without this script

also this can be easily altered for TV shows if you need that too!
